## Semantic segmentation using SR images

- [ ] Semantic segmentation using SR images
	- [x] Download series of Sentinel images
	- [x] Super resolve images
		- [x] One patch at a time versus batch processing
			-> Seems to be the same image 
			
			| Batch processing | One patch at a time |
			| ------------------ | -------------------- |
			|  ![[res 1.png]] | ![[sr6_image_0_0_0.png]] |
			  
	- [ ] Data loaders for different type of input data
		- [ ] Different file format loading
		- [ ] Index shuffling (for validation and testing) -> no longer index is the only integer in the name
	- [ ] Wallonia lables -> create + downscale
	- [ ] Train model
		- [ ] Which patches to use? -> many of them wouldn't contain any pixels labeled as forest
- [ ] Compare Super-resolution vs. Multi-spectral data
	- [ ] Train MS data 
		 -> upscale result and compute error to the target
		 -> Some metric to compare results
	- [ ] Add Multi-spectral data to SR -> upscale
