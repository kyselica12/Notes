As the leader of an oil-exploration drilling venture, you must determine the least-cost selection of 5 out of 10 possible sites. Label the sites $S_1, S_2, . . . , S_{10}$, and the exploration costs associated with each as $C_1,C_2, . . . ,C_10$.

--
Regional development restrictions are such that:
- Evaluating sites $S1$ and $S7$ will prevent you from exploring site $S8$.
- Evaluating sites $S1$ or $S4$ prevents you from assessing site $S8$.
- Of the group $S5$, $S6$, $S7$, $S8$, only two sites may be assessed.

Formulate an integer program to determine the minimum-cost exploration scheme that satisfies these restrictions.
