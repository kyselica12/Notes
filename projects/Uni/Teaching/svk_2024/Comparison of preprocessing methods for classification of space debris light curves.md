As traffic in Earth orbit increases, so does the amount of space debris orbiting the Earth. A large
proportion of these objects are non-functioning satellites and rocket parts. In the long term, it is important
to remove these objects.  An object's light curve, which contains consecutive observations, carry
information about its properties. With the help of analytical methods used in astronomy, it is possible
to methodically extract partial information from light curves. In classification tasks, different preprocessing methods have huge
influence on the accuracy of the trained models. We compare multiple preprocessing methods focusing on
the improvement in the hard classification cases especially rocket bodies.
